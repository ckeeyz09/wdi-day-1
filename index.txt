Three things I learned:
1. Everything that is transferred over the internet, be it video, calls, etc., is broken down into small sections called packets. Each packet is about 1000-1500 bytes in size.

2. The newest form of IP addresses, IPv6, uses an IP address that is 128 characters long.

3. My code will never work the first time. And probably not the second time either.
