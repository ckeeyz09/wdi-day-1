One of my passions has always been video games. I have always been interested in how they work, what the work is that goes into making them so fluid, and if I was able to make one of my own. I think one of the things I’m most excited about is building my own independent game from the ground up. I don’t know how long the project would take, but I want to learn the languages I need to know to build it and just do it. I have tons of ideas for games and I can’t wait to get them made. In the mean time, I think I want to build game utility apps. Something that gamers can use to enhance their experience, even if it means just working on an existing utility like Twitch.tv
